This file is not distributed with the module. It outlines some notes for
developers readying a set of files for distribution.

Check for any open issues:
- https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=Benchmark-Timer
- https://code.google.com/p/benchmark-timer/issues/list

git checkout:
$ git clone https://github.com/coppit/benchmark-timer.git

When running "perl Makefile.PL" on a new system, it will complain about the
check_optional() call in Makefile.PL. Simply copy the
inc/Module/Install/CheckOptional.pm from a previous release. (I haven't gotten
around to releasing Module::Install::CheckOptional as a module, since it's so
trivial.)

Checklist for a release:
- Be sure to add new test cases for new features
- Make sure version number increases.
- Add version changes to CHANGES
- Add new module dependencies to Makefile.PL, and update README
- Update MANIFEST and MANIFEST.SKIP if necessary.
  $ make distcheck
- Test your distribution:
  $ make realclean
  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ make test
- After the tests have passed, make the distribution file:
  $ make dist
- Install the distribution file elsewhere to test it.
- Upload to CPAN:
    http://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery
  or
    cpan-upload Benchmark-Timer-X.XX.tar.gz
- Tag the release for easy retrieval later
  $ git tag -a v0.7100 -m 'Version 0.7100'
- Push changes to github:
  $ git push
