- Add an option to set the output filehandle (instead of always using STDERR)
  for stat reporting
- Figure out mod_perl integration (maybe allow an output callback so you could
  pass it a sub { Apache->request->log->info(@_) } or similar)
- Work (in a handicapped way) even if Time::HiRes is unavailable (just go to
  the nearest second, and hope that you're timing something that's really
  lengthy!)
- Plug in to different statistics modules (like yours)
