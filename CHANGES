0.5 - April 20, 2001

  * Added functionality to skip trials when doing repeated trials
    via a "skip" constructor parameter, plus tests for this.
  * Consistently use croak() and carp() instead of die() and warn().
  * Added error tests to test that error conditions are properly met.
  * Renamed Benchmark::Timer object to $t in the test cases to make
    them more conventional.

0.4 - March 29, 2001

  * Changed internal method representation to an array instead of a
    hash, for a tiny but measureable speed increase.
  * Corrected timestr() to display microseconds and show integral times.
  * Added delta.pl, a small script that calculates the approximate
    overhead of using Benchmark::Timer versus plain Time::HiRes calls.

0.3 - March 26, 2001

  * Renamed Time::Timer to Benchmark::Timer after some discussion on
    the comp.lang.perl.modules newsgroup.

0.2 - March 24, 2001

  * Added $t->result, $t->results, and $t->data methods to access data.
  * warn() instead of puke when $t->report is called while an event is

0.1 - March 23, 2001

  * Original version, created by Andrew Ho (andrew@zeuscat.com), rolled.
