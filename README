Benchmark::Timer

Perl extension to benchmark code, with or without statistical confidence.


NEW IN THIS VERSION

- Maintenance of the module transferred to David Coppit <david@coppit.org>
- License changed to GNU GPL.
- Improved reporting to support multiple tags
- Added statistical sampling, allowing the user to time code until a certain
  confidence level is reached. (Added error() and confidence() to support this
  functionality)

MODULE DEPENDENCIES

You will need to install Time::HiRes to use Benchmark::Timer. The easiest way
to install it is to run:

  perl -MCPAN -e 'install Time::HiRes'

If you intend on using the statistical features, you will also need to install
Statistics::PointEstimation.

INSTALLATION

To install this package, change to the directory where you unarchived this
distribution and type the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

During the 'make test', the statistical test may take some time to run,
depending on how accurate "sleep(1)" is on your system. The normal time is
less than 5 seconds.

If you do not have root access on your machine, then you may not have the
ability to install this module in the standard perl library path. You may
direct the installation into your own space, e.g.,

  perl Makefile.PL LIB='/home/userid/lib'

or perhaps the entire installation, e.g.,

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX='/home/userid'

If you make the installation into your own directory, then remember that you
must tell perl where to search for modules before trying to 'use' them. For
example:

  use lib '/home/userid/lib';
  use Benchmark::Timer;


NOTES

Please let me know if you are using this module. Tell me what bugs you find or
what can be done to improve it.
