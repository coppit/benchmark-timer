Benchmark::Timer - Benchmarking with statistical confidence

Perl extension to benchmark code, with or without statistical confidence.


NEW IN THIS VERSION

Version 0.7100: Tue Dec 21 2004
- Fixed version numbers, which were incompatible with some modules.


MODULE DEPENDENCIES

To use this module, you will need to install:

- Time::HiRes

If you intend on using the statistical features, you will also need to
install:

- Statistics::PointEstimation.

You should be prompted to install these modules automatically when you run
"perl Makefile.PL".


INSTALLATION

To install this package, change to the directory where you unarchived this
distribution and type the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

You can install this package into a non-default location by appending one of
the following to the "perl Makefile.PL" command:

- "PREFIX=/installation/path" (for installation into a custom location),
- "INSTALLDIRS=site" (for installation into site-specific Perl directories)
- "INSTALLDIRS=perl" (for installation into standard Perl directories).

If you make the installation into your own directory, then remember that you
must tell perl where to search for modules before trying to 'use' them. For
example:

  use lib '/home/userid/lib';
  use Benchmark::Timer;

During the 'make test', the statistical test may take some time to run,
depending on how accurate "sleep(1)" is on your system. The normal time is
less than 5 seconds.


DOCUMENTATION

Just "perldoc Benchmark::Timer". After installation on Unix systems,
you can also do "man Benchmark::Timer".
